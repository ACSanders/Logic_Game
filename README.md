## Description
This is a game that serves as a great study tool for anyone who is interested in learning about logic. It covers aspects of propositional logic including syntax, propositions, truth values, and truth functions. The user can select one of the following types of statements: negation, conjunction, disjunction, conditional, and biconditional. After making a selection, the user will learn more about syntax, propositions, and truth values. Next, the user will assign truth values to the component parts of a statement (the atomic propositions). The user will also use truch functional connectives to determine a truth value for a complex statement.
